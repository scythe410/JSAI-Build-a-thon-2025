**Review of code-review.genai.js**

**Issues & Suggestions:**

1. **'await' usage without async function**
   - The top-level `const changes = await git.diff({ staged: true });` will throw unless inside an async function or using top-level await in a supported environment. Standard Node.js without ESM or latest features doesn't allow this.
   - **Fix:** Wrap logic in an async function or ensure the environment supports top-level await.

2. **Unclear function: defDiff**
   - `defDiff("CODE_CHANGES", changes);` references a function not defined or imported in this file. Causes ReferenceError.
   - **Fix:** Implement or import `defDiff`.

3. **Mixing Template Literals with $-tag**
   - `$` likely refers to a tagged template function, but it's not defined/imported here, causing a ReferenceError.
   - **Fix:** Define `$` or use standard template literals.

4. **Markdown Block in JS**
   - The block with `## Role`... is plain markdown inside JS. If this is not meant for actual functional processing, clarify intent or export it. Typically, config/prose should be in comments or separate files.

**Improvements:**
- Add error handling for async/await and git operations.
- Clearly document external dependencies (`git`, `$`, and `defDiff`).
- Place descriptive comments at the top.

**Summary:**  
The file is incomplete and will not execute as intended due to undefined references and improper async usage. Ensure all functions and runtime requirements are well defined and imported, following JS/module best practices.
